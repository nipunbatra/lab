But, it needs deliberate practice.\n\nPaper structure and Abstract\nI gave a talk (recording here, slides here) on how to write a paper. I recommend watching it. Other materials from the talk are available here.\n\n\nLaTeXify figures\n\n\nSelf-contained figures and tables (and captions)\n\n\nTables\nWe follow this excellent small guide to making nice tables by Markus Püschel.\n\n\nComments in LaTeX\nWe typically create a macro corresponding to different author initials (I use \\nb for example) and then use that to create comments in the text. This is useful for commenting on the text, or for leaving notes to yourself. For example, I might write \\nb{I'm not sure about this sentence} and then I can search for all instances of \\nb to find all of my comments.\n\\newcommand{\\nb}[1]{{\\color{red}\\small \\iftoggle{hide}{}{\\textbf{Nipun's comment:} #1}}}\n\n\nActive v/s Passive Voice\n\n\nAmerican v/s British English\nThere are a few differences in spelling between American and British English. For example, the word “colour” in British English is spelled “color” in American English. The word “optimise” in British English is spelled “optimize” in American English. There are also some differences in grammar. I recommend picking one and sticking to it. Most of our previous papers have used British English (but often this depends on the set of co-authors).\n\n\nPaper timelines\n\n\nGrammarly and other AI tools\nI recommend students use Grammarly (or a similar) tool to check their writing once they have done a complete pass of editing. I do not recommend relying a lot on ChatGPT-like tools for writing papers as they can often lead to “correct” sounding but “incorrect” sentences.",

    "text": "ES 654: My Foray into Machine Learning\nMy journey into Machine Learning began with securing an internship at BEES Lab, IISc Bangalore, after my sophomore year. This experience plunged me into the thrilling world of Machine Learning. As a newcomer, I found the field daunting, filled with advanced concepts and rapidly evolving technologies. It was challenging to grasp the essence of Machine Learning and delve deeper. I pondered on differentiating myself from being just another coder proficient in CNN architectures using PyTorch to understanding fundamental concepts like the impact of a single LayerNorm block on model performance, the role of regularization in inducing generality, and the importance of visualizing the workings of the so-called “black box” of a neural network. The learning curve seemed colossal. Fortuitously, it was during this time that I was introduced to the course ES 654, an introduction to Machine Learning, taught by Prof. Nipun.\nFrom the very first class, where Prof. Nipun introduced us to the broad scope of AI, I knew this course would be a turning point in my career. His teaching approach made me realize the importance of understanding classical Machine Learning’s intuition, often overshadowed by implicit modeling in Neural Modelling Strategies. The course took us from implementing Decision Trees and various classical Machine Learning algorithms in pure Python to building neural networks from scratch. It illuminated the intuition behind optimization strategies and autograd workings. The structured learning helped solidify my foundation in Machine Learning. Particularly impactful were the on-paper tests, where we derived vectorized solutions to various problems, significantly boosting my confidence and understanding."

The best thing about Prof. Nipun was the way he streamlined the learning experience and crafted it individually for every single student. My initial task involved bug fixes in Pyro, a deep probabilistic programming library on Pytorch. This was my first foray into open-source ML contributions, and Prof. Nipun’s guidance was invaluable. I remember him hand-holding me in this task and giving me code suggestions before I made the commits. The best part was him celebrating with me on the small victory of the first PR getting merged! This marked the beginning of my deep dive into Bayesian Machine Learning, focusing on Gaussian Processes and Neural Kernel Networks, which became my primary areas of interest at SL."

The highlight of my time at SL were the weekly meetings with Prof. Nipun. His guidance extended beyond theoretical solutions to the nitty-gritty of implementation. His mentorship played a crucial role in my development, not just academically but also in how I approach problems in my current corporate research role at Skan.

However, often the difference between a good and great project is the consistency of effort.\nStriving for excellence: Often, the difference between a good and great project (or paper) is the last 10% of effort. I try to push my students to go the extra mile, and I expect the same from myself. This goes in various aspects of work, including writing, coding, and data analysis. As an example, I remember doing ten rounds of feedback with an undergraduate student from the group on their presentation for a conference. It was a lot of work, but the student ended up getting offers (higher studies) after the talk; and the student was appreciated by the session chair - “It is hard to believe that you are an undergraduate student”.\nClear, honest communication I try to be as clear as possible in my communication, and I expect the same from my students. I also expect my students to be honest with me. If you are struggling with something, let me know. If you are not interested in a project, let me know. If you are not happy with something, let me know. I you are unable to meet a deadline, let me know. Lack of communication is counterproductive.\nI also typically want to help create a path for my students to achieve their goals.

It was the first time in my undergraduate studies when I felt like going to a class 😊. And it was his teachings that made me knock on the doors of the Sustainability Lab. I first met Prof. Batra and asked him if he could help me get an internship. I had no thoughts then on a summer internship under him, and the rest is history. I was very disappointed about not getting a foreign research internship, and even though he didn’t know me, he was all willing to help me out. I had finally found a mentor in him. From the very same semester, I started working with the Lab and then onwards there was no looking back. And now whenever I think about my BTech, this lab was a big part of it. \nI have worked on 4 different projects and some open-source contributions for one and a half years. When the entire world was going crazy behind deep neural networks, it was under him that I explored the probabilistic machine learning models. And got a whole new perspective on ML. My first-ever project was on Deep Gaussian Processes for Air Quality Inference, though this was a course project, it never felt that way. There was continuous guidance from him and his PhD Zeel Patel. Though we had limited time we were able to make significant contributions. We as undergrads (other collaborators Eshan Gujarathi, Saagar Parikh, and Sachin Yadav)  were able to publish our work as an extended abstract at ACM India, 6th Joint International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data CODS-COMAD 2023. I also had the privilege of presenting this work at the conference, and to our surprise, we were the only undergrads who had published their work. We recently got one citation, hurray my H-Index is now 1 😊."

    "text": "Deep Dive!\nBuilding on my knowledge of Gaussian Processes (GPs), I delved deeper into the nitty-gritty of its working. In my third-year summer internship, I had the opportunity to work on Batched Gaussian Processes. It was this solo research that gave me a lot of confidence in myself and though it was difficult to understand the math behind GPs, Prof. Batra and other labmates were always there to help me out. Prof. Batra is extremely reachable, you just have to ask him and he will instantly set up a meeting and will explain everything with great passion every time. I just used to wonder at times, how passionate a person can be. The thing about this lab is that you don’t feel like you are working for the first time, so welcoming is the atmosphere. I still cherish the AB6 Workspace where we as a lab used to spend the entire day, have fun, and help each other. His feedback during research meetings might feel harsh at times but yes that always motivated me to work to the best of my potential. One of the best parts of working with this Lab is that Prof. Batra knows what our future goals are and accordingly assigns projects to students considering his/her interests. I still remember that he knew I was applying for a master’s and he put me on an application-based project and pushed me to publish a paper in AAAI or NeurIPS. Until then I had never even dreamt of such a publication. \nAnd guess what I was successful in publishing my work on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) using Bayesian deep learning strategies like Gaussian Processes in the NeurIPS workshop on Gaussian Processes in 2023 (collaborator: Gautam Vashishtha). A lot of credit goes to Prof. Batra and PhD Zeel. It was my experience of GPs from the summer that helped me quickly get going with this tough problem. And this work of mine has to be the highlight of my BTech. This work not only molded me into a good researcher but also taught me numerous life lessons. Prof. Batra’s dedication in academia as well as in day-to-day life always motivated me to do better each day. Every time I used to go with some updates on the work done, he would always point out even the minutest details, you might feel does it even matter. But believe me, it does, this makes you perfect at what you do, not only in research! I learned how to write good papers, and how to do productive research. “Drawing conclusions or insights is the key to any research problem” - were always the words of Prof. Nipun Batra!\nThis project had lots of ups and downs but he always pushed me whenever I felt low and felt like the project was not heading anywhere. But you have to trust Prof. Batra and follow his advice especially when you feel everything is going down the spiral. Prof. Batra’s words still echo in my ears, never run behind publications, and don’t think much about the end goal. Just focus on your current work, set smaller milestones, and keep producing results and you will never know when you will have a flurry of publications. Isn’t this relevant to anything you do in life, just focus on the present! My last work with this lab was on Multi Output models for air quality inference. Every new project feels like a new challenge but when you have an excellent mentor and support in the lab the job is half done. By the beginning of this project, I started enjoying research. To touch on another aspect, I had never realized the importance of open-source contributions unless I joined this Lab. The excellent environment at the lab of always helping ML society, helped me make contributions to Dr. Kevin Murphy’s (Google Researcher) Book."

Whether it be university selection, the application process, SoP, CV, or anything related he will always be there. I was just amazed by the way Prof. Batra reviewed my SOP and Resume word by word not only once but several times. I used to always get blunt feedback but that helped me prepare a strong application (studying today at one of the finest!). He always cares for his students, and even used to tell us to sleep well, focus on health, and then prioritize work. I have written more about the lessons I learned working with him, make sure you read that, if the above didn’t motivate you enough to join his lab."

On Lab outings, his “Delhi ka ladka” comes out and he is extremely jovial to talk with. The lab celebrations on paper publications or any achievements, Prof. Batra personally greeted us the very best during our farewell dinner and the Akshardham dinner visits will always be remembered! But the best part which makes me emotional every time I read is the personalized message in a book he gave each of his graduating students. And I have even carried that to the USA, that just makes me believe every time I feel low. \nFinally, I will always miss having fun and working with Vibhuti Bansal, Eshan Gujarathi, Gautam Vashishtha, Saagar Parikh, Hitarth Gandhi, Progyan Das, Hetvi Shastri, Palak Purohit, Harsh Patel, Shivam Sahini, Sachin Yadav, Karm Patel, Hrushti Naik, Shreyashi Singh, and PhD Zeel Patel. I always miss lab meetings and learning from him. Thank you, Prof. Batra, Zeel, and other members of the lab for the wonderful memories and learnings. My experience at this lab has prepared me for my future goals! And I am sure if anytime I feel like I need some advice, Prof. Batra will just be a call away!\n\nAadesh Desai\n\nFeel Free to contact me anytime."

This work was accepted at ACM Buildsys 2021, and I presented virtually at the conference. During my final year, I worked on quantifying uncertainty in NILM, collaborating and mentoring summer interns (Vibhuti, Rohit, and Haikoo). This work was accepted at ACM Buildsys 2022, and I presented it at Boston. Besides this, I was a TA for the Machine Learning course (ES654) taught by Prof. Nipun Batra. I have taken two courses, Operating System and Machine Learning, with Prof. Nipun Batra. Having collaborated with Prof. Nipun Batra for almost three years, Sustainability Lab feels like a second home. So I have summed up a few learnings from my time at the lab which are even helping me during my graduate studies."

I got a low rank in the entire electrical batch, which made it impossible for me to get a research internship through college. Still, I was so firm that I used to mail professors and Ph.D. students in the US and try to find some opportunity. Through this process, I got one reply from a Ph.D. student at CMU explaining to me that I should focus on doing good work rather than finding an internship at a good place. After reading this, I joined the Sustainability lab for my summer internship with Prof. Nipun Batra. I first encountered Prof. Nipun Batra during an Operating System course in the fall of 2021. After this, I took a machine learning course in the spring of 2021. His teaching style is very intuitive, which sparked my interest in machine learning. My summer internship work got me a paper at an international conference, and due to this, I received my Ph.D. admission at UMass Amherst. Through this experience, I learned that rather than running behind the tags, if you work hard at what you like, it pays off well."

During my internship, I was never treated as a junior. Even as an Electrical Engineering student, Prof. Nipun Batra consistently showed confidence in me, assigning me an independent project. My ideas were valued equally, and I was treated on par with Ph.D. students. He involved me in industry meetings, providing insights beyond academia. In my last year, Prof. Batra gave me the opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant and my first academic talk for the Machine Learning course. This experience significantly boosted my confidence. I even got an opportunity to guide interns in Summer 2022. With a collective effort, we submitted a full paper at Buildsys 2022, marking a successful collaboration. Most of my academic “first times”, like my first paper, first talk, and first research talk, have happened at the lab only because Nipun Sir has always shown great confidence in me, which motivated me to work. You will always get an opportunity at the Sustainability lab if you try to put some effort into learning."

During my presentation at international conferences, Prof Nipun Batra helped me create and improve my presentation skills. I presented and recorded my presentation plenty of times, and he has patiently tried to improve my minute mistakes. We ultimately got positive reviews at the conference. During this experience, I learned that it would first seem a lot to do, but if you go with the flow, even small things impact on a large scale."

Currently, I am a Senior Consultant at eClerx, where I specialise in Data Analytics and Engineering for a global investment bank.\nI had the privilege to work with Prof. Nipun as one of his first M.Tech students. This post narrates my enriching experience under his mentorship.\n Picture 1: (Dec 2022) returned to college for a late convocation.\n\n\nResearch Endeavours and Milestones\nThe M.Tech program consisted of 50% coursework and 50% research. My work with Prof. Nipun started in January 2019, broadly focusing on air quality estimation.\n• Experimention with portable air quality sensors (Jan 2019 - Apr 2019)\nI measured PM2.5 exposure among construction workers and calibrated five sensors to plot and analyse the data.\n Picture 2: (Feb 2019) calibrating Atmos air quality sensors at my workspace\n\n\nDeveloping a Live Air quality dashboard (May 2019 - Jul 2019)\nI deployed 5 air quality sensors across the campus and created a live dashboard using JavaScript, Python (Flask), and Leaflet.js. This project was crucial in identifying high pollution activities and their timings.\n\nPicture 3: (May 2019) Installing an air quality sensor at IIT Gn\n\nPicture 4: (Jun 2019) Live air quality measurements across 5 locations on campus\nI got introduced to interdisciplinary research - the goal was to calculate the exposure of PM2.5 in our college bus route. I worked in Tinkerer’s lab with a mechanical engineer to design a 3D printed mount using MDF, which was mounted in the moving bus:\n\n• Estimating ground air quality using satellite data (Aug 2019 - Dec 2019)\nAir quality sensors were expensive and provided less spatial coverage, we used satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological fields to estimate surface-level PM2.5 using a regression model.\nProf. Nipun encouraged me to write a short 1-page paper and submit it to CoDS-COMAD. I got my first short paper published [link] at ISB Hyderabad in January 2020. Fun fact: the presentation coincided with my birthday :)\n\nPicture 5: (Jan 2020) Presenting at CoDS-COMAD conference in ISB Hyderabad\n• Data Curation and Machine Learning (Jan 2020 - Jul 2020)\nGathered PM, AOD, and meteorological data for India through various sources and collated them in time and space. Used Ridge regression, random forest, time-series cross-validation for our analysis like seasonal variation in pollution. This study helped us in identifying the challenges for data curation and collocation for India.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the research, here are some links - [video][slides][pdf]\n\n\nBeyond Research\nThe learnings from Prof. Nipun that still resonate with me:\n\nDiscipline &gt; motivation\nPrioritise your health\nValuing the impact of work over accolades and recognition\n\nDuring my last semester in college, there was an abrupt change in our work due to lockdown and COVID. Prof. Nipun was supportive and understanding, guided me with my thesis and empathised during hard situations at home.\nProf. Nipun didn’t hand me solutions that cultivated a mindset of problem solving. This mindset helped me deal with different situations in my professional life too. I’d be forever grateful that I could have him as my thesis supervisor in college, and a lifelong mentor in life.\n\nPicture 6: A view from the terrace of my workspace, overlooking the Sabarmati river, was a constant reminder of how beautiful the campus is, and how privileged I was to be working there."
